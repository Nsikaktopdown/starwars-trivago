# Star Wars Universe

Android Coding Test from Trivago

## Getting Started
This test was built base on the requirement from the Zealpath invite.

### My Approach

I decide to use Clean Architecture pattern because this helps me have independent business logic, UI,
data source and also having the module more readable and also easy to Unit test.

## Steps

1. Designed a mockup with [Figma](https://figma.com)
2. Carefully analysed the Swap api endpoints and it response format
3. Got my already structured base project ready
4. Started Implementation following the requirement
5. Tested with my Emulator once  done with a particular feature
6. Got the project ready for submission
7. Wrote this Readme file 


### Libraries Used
* [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) -  for Dependency Injection
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/google/dagger) - Network Request
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) -  Json library from Square
