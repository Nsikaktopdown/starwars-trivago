# Star Wars Universe

Coding Test from Trivago

## Getting Started
This test was built base on the requirement from the Zealpath invite.

### My Approach

I decide to use Clean Architecture pattern because this helps me have independent business logic, UI,
data source  and making the project more readable and also easy to Unit test.


### Libraries Used
* [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) -  for Dependency Injection
* [Retrofit](https://github.com/google/dagger) - Network Request
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) -  Json library from Square
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) -  Persistence Library from Google
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) -  Reactive Programming Library
